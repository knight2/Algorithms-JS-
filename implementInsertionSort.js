/*
This sorting method works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of a list.
It begins the sorted array with the first element. Then it inspects the next
element and swaps it backwards into the sorted array until it is in sorted position.
It continues iterating through the list and swapping new items backwards into the sorted
portion until it reaches the end. This algorithm has quadratic time complexity
in the average and worse cases.
