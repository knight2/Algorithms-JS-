//Given an array arr, find element pairs whose sum
//equals the second argument args, and return the sum of their indices
//You may use multiple pairs that have the same numeric elements
// but different indicies.

/*
Each pair should use the lowest possible available indices. Once an element has been used it cannot be reused to pair with another element. For instance, pairwise([1, 1, 2], 3) creates a pair [2, 1] using the 1 at index 0 rather than the 1 at index 1, because 0+2 < 1+2.

For example pairwise([7, 9, 11, 13, 15], 20) returns 6. The pairs that sum to 20 are [7, 13] and [9, 11]. We can then write out the array with their indices and values.
